These are my submissions for my CSCE 101 Intro to Computer Science class at UAA. 
They include 10 small programs to be written in Python. If we deviated from the
information we learned in class we were to report why we did below.

Here are my defenses for why I made certain decisions:

Q1) I wasn't sure if we were allowed to slice strings, since we only tangentially covered this topic
in zybooks. So I added a second method of arriving at the same answer that we definitely covered 
in class.

Q2) I have no idea how we're supposed to do the second question without some kind of iterative,
so I made a loop that compares whole words with each other. I also wasn't sure if we were supposed
to remove punctuation so I didn't.

Q5) Another question I wasn't sure how to do without looping through the list. Unless the list was 1 
element long I feel iteration is required to check the rest of the loop.
